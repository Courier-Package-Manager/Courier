📦 Package manager for python


## Overview of Features
As seen in [Trakr](https://github.com/JoshuaDRose/Trakr), a package management system
was introduced which assisted the installation and maintance of Trakr's dependencies.
This project hopes to extend upon that package management system, and develop further
features in the hope that it will assist with the local dependency maintaince of future
projects.

Tox is planning to make an entrance sooner or later in this project once enough code 
is written and enough substantial unit tests are introduced. The process of automating
testing will also greatly help me test less because everything is being automated. More
on this to come once unit tests are introduced.
## Contributing
When making commits in a forked repository (with the intent of a pr) please ensure that
you read the [commits](commits.md) syntax file. Note that this file also generally applies
to pull requests as well. There are plans to make a contributing file in the future, however
that is nor needed or relevant right now but will be introduced if there is good reason for 
doing so. Contributions are always encouraged and appreciated.
