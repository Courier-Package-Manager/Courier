syntax: courier install <package> [version]

Install a specific package. Courier will search pip to see if 
the package already exists, if not it will automatically install. 
If a version is specified it will install that specific version.

If Courier has detected that a package is installed but not up-to-date then
it will automatically update without prompting the user.
If package is more than one word use quotation marks

courier install "foo bar"

with version:
courier install "foo bar" 3.4.5

Developer note: I'm planning to change force upgrade once future arguments are introduced.
